Q2B Objective
Now that the robot is aligned in the direction of the ArUco marker, move it 30 centimeters towards
ArUco marker. This can be achieved by utilizing the rotary encoders on the pioneer to measure how far
the wheels have moved over time. You must use these encoders as feedback to determine how far the robot
has traveled. To do this, subscribe to the /pose topic after running the p2os driver.launch file to obtain the
odometry messages which contain the rotary encoder information. See Odometry message type. Publish a
constant linear velocity of 0.20m/s to the /cmd vel topic to move the robot until it has traveled your desired
distance. Finally, print the distance the robot has traveled and the current value of Î´.
